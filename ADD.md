# Backend Development Skills for 2025 (Python & Django Focus)

## Fundamentals

### 1. Language & Framework

- **Python** with **Django**.
- Languages focused on high performance: Go, Kotlin, Rust

### 2. Version Control (Recommended addition)

- Git and GitHub/GitLab for code collaboration and deployment workflows.

## Data Management

### 3. SQL (Relational Databases)

- **SQL:** This is considered **obligatory**, going beyond basic queries to include knowledge of **triggers, stored procedures, functions, and SQL security**. Understanding SQL is crucial even with knowledge of ORMs.

### 4. NoSQL (Non-Relational Databases)

- **NoSQL:** It's important to understand when NoSQL databases like **MongoDB** or **Redis** are beneficial, particularly for handling large amounts of unrelated data. Knowing the pros and cons of SQL vs. NoSQL is essential.

### 5. ORM (Object-Relational Mapper)

- Learning and using the ORM specific to your framework (e.g., Django ORM) is essential for faster development. However, it's also crucial to understand how to analyze the queries generated by the ORM for optimization and know when to use stored procedures or raw SQL.

## Security & Authentication

### 6. OWASP Top 10

- Understanding the **OWASP Top 10** security standards is crucial for developing secure applications.

### 7. Security Technologies

- Understanding authentication and authorization technologies like **OAuth 2.0, OpenID**, and especially **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** is important. JWT is considered **obligatory** to know how it's formed, used, and its purpose.

## Software Design & Architecture

### 8. Software Design and Architecture

- Learning software architecture (like Clean Architecture) and software design principles is essential for building scalable systems. Familiarity with design patterns commonly used in backend development and within specific frameworks is also important.

### 9. Dependency Injection

- This is considered **obligatory** as it helps to decouple modules in your system and separate business rules.

### 10. Business Rules

- Understanding and being able to identify and separate business rules within the software architecture is highlighted as a key differentiator.

## Infrastructure & DevOps

### 11. Cloud Platforms

- Familiarity with at least one major cloud platform like **Google Cloud, Azure, or AWS** is now considered **obligatory**. Understanding core services like lambdas/functions and storage (e.g., S3) is important.

### 12. Docker & Kubernetes

- While not strictly obligatory, familiarity with **Docker** (at least being able to lift a project) is highly recommended due to job market demands for containerization knowledge.

## Resilience & Performance

### 13. Resilience Patterns

- Learning about resilience patterns (like timeouts and retries) and libraries that implement them (like Polly in .NET) is important for building fault-tolerant applications.

### 14. Memory Cache

- Utilizing memory caching technologies like **Redis** is important for improving performance, especially with frequent similar requests. Techniques like memoization are also relevant.

### 15. Concurrency

- Understanding concurrency and the limitations of your technology is important for backend development. Understanding concepts like async/await is crucial.

### 16. Background Tasks

- Knowing how to implement background tasks for long-running processes and task queuing is important for improving user experience.

## Testing & Documentation

### 17. Unit Testing

- Knowing how to write unit tests with your framework is **obligatory** for ensuring code quality.

### 18. API Documentation (Swagger)

- Knowing how to use tools like **Swagger** to document your backend API is important for facilitating communication and integration with frontend developers.

## AI-Assisted Development

### 19. LLMs (Large Language Models)

- Utilizing AI tools like **ChatGPT, Copilot**, etc., as assistants is now considered **obligatory**.
