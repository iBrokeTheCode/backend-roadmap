- NoSQL Databases (Concepts: CAP, BASE; Use cases; Intro to MongoDB & Redis basics) - Est. Time: 5 days

> [!NOTE]
> Core Practice: Apply clean code principles to queries and data access layers.
> Tools: PostgreSQL, pgAdmin/DBeaver, MongoDB, Redis.
> Practical Application: Implement complex data models and interactions in your portfolio project.
> Estimated Module Time: ~3 Weeks (approx. 120 hours)

## Module 4: Deployment & Infrastructure (DevOps Basics)

- Goal: Understand how to package, deploy, and manage backend applications in real-world environments.

### Topics

- Containerization with Docker (Dockerfiles, Docker Compose, Registries, Best practices) - Est. Time: 5 days
- Cloud Platform Fundamentals (Choose AWS/GCP/Azure: Core Compute, Storage, Database, Basic Networking) - Est. Time: 7 days
- Basic CI/CD (GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for automated testing & deployment) - Est. Time: 4 days
- Web Servers & Reverse Proxies (Nginx config basics, Gunicorn/Uvicorn) - Est. Time: 2 days
- Introduction to Logging & Monitoring (Concepts, Basic tools) - Est. Time: 2 days

> [!NOTE]
> Core Practice: Write clear and maintainable Dockerfiles and CI/CD configurations.
> Tools: Docker, Docker Compose, AWS/GCP/Azure CLI & Console, Nginx, Gunicorn/Uvicorn, GitHub Actions/GitLab CI.
> Practical Application: Containerize and deploy your portfolio project using CI/CD.
> Estimated Module Time: ~3 Weeks (approx. 120 hours)

## Module 5: Advanced Topics & Job Readiness
